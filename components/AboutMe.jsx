        <h4 className="thanks">Thank you for visiting my page!</h4>I'm a
        Software dev, graduate from General Assembly's Software Engineering
        Immersive bootcamp, and lifelong learner with a passion to merge
        creativity with the art of problem-solving.

          While my initial career trajectory saw me flying jets for an Airline,
          The Tech world has always piqued my interest. I grew up with a
          software engineer father (who likes to tell me about how much harder
          it is to work in Perl / cold fusion than JavaScript...) & spent
          countless hours as a teenager modding video games!
        </div>
        My background as an airline pilot and flight instructor fostered a
        rigorous appetite for all sorts of things that move and the ways in
        which they work.
        <br></br>In my spare time youâ€™ll find me ripping the guitar in a live
        setting, riding in a bike lane, or competitively racing on the weekends!
        <br></br>Let's build something together :)
