        <h4 className="thanks">Thank you for visiting my page!</h4>I'm a
        Software dev who's recently graduated from General Assembly's Software
        Engineering Immersive bootcamp with a passion to merge creativity with
        the art of problem-solving.{' '}

          Although not the route I originally embarked down with primary school
          & college, the world of tech has always piqued my interest, as I grew
          up with a software engineer father (who always likes to tell me about
          how much harder it is to work in Perl / cold fusion than
          JavaScript...)

        My background as an airline pilot and flight instructor fostered a
        rigorous appetite for all sorts of things that move and the ways in
        which they work. I am currently applying the skills I've gained in my
        journey to build challenging & fulfilling projects.
        <br></br>In my spare time youâ€™ll find me ripping the guitar in a live
        setting, riding in a bike lane, or competitively racing on the weekends.
        <br></br>Let's build something together :)
